With nearly three decades of singular focus, NVIDIA is expert at accelerating software and scaling compute by a Million-X, going well beyond Moore‚Äôs law. Accelerated computing requires full-stack innovation‚Äîoptimizing across every layer of computing‚Äîfrom silicon and systems to software and algorithms, demanding deep understanding of the problem domain.

Our full-stack platforms‚ÄîNVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Omniverse‚Äîaccelerate AI and industrial digitalization workloads. We accelerate workloads at data center scale, across thousands of compute nodes, treating the network and storage as part of the computing fabric. Our platform extends from the cloud and enterprise data centers to supercomputing centers, edge computing and PCs.

# What Is Accelerated Computing?

A full-stack approach: silicon, systems, software

Not just a superfast chip‚Äîaccelerated computing is a full-stack combination of:

- Chip(s) with specialized processors
- Algorithms in acceleration libraries
- Domain experts to refactor applications

To speed-up compute-intensive parts of an application

Amdahl‚Äôs law:

The overall system speed-up (S) gained by optimizing a single part of a system by a factor (s) is limited by the proportion of execution time of that part (p).

ùëÜ = 1 / (1 ‚àí ùëù + ùë†)

For example:

- If 90% of the runtime can be accelerated by 100X, the application is sped up 9X
- If 99% of the runtime can be accelerated by 100X, the application is sped up 50X
- If 80% of the runtime can be accelerated by 500X, or even 1000X, the application is sped up 5X<!--- Page 5 --->

# The NVIDIA AI Foundry Model on DGX Cloud

For building enterprise AI applications Pre-trained LLMs

NVIDIA‚Äôs ‚ÄúAI foundry‚Äù service leverages our AI infrastructure and expertise to build custom AI models for enterprise customers‚Äî analogous to a semiconductor foundry that uses its infrastructure and expertise to build custom chips for fabless customers.

An enterprise customer starts with an NVIDIA or 3rd party pre-trained AI model, available in NVIDIA AI Foundations. This model making service includes frameworks such as NVIDIA NeMo for custom LLMs and NVIDIA Picasso for custom generative AI for visual design. With help from NVIDIA experts, the enterprise customer fine-tunes the model on their proprietary enterprise data and adds guardrails, using tools available in NVIDIA AI Foundations.

The fine-tuning and optimization is done on NVIDIA DGX Cloud, a cloud service that allows enterprises immediate access to NVIDIA AI infrastructure and software, hosted at partner cloud providers. The enterprise customer ends up with a fully-trained and optimized AI model, fine-tuned on their proprietary enterprise data, that can be deployed anywhere‚Äîin the cloud or on-prem.

The NVIDIA AI Foundry model generates revenue based on per-node, per-month consumption of NVIDIA DGX Cloud.<!--- Page 18 --->

Accelerated computing requires full-stack and data center-scale innovation across silicon, systems, algorithms, and applications.

Significant expertise and effort are required, but application speed-ups can be incredible, resulting in dramatic cost and time-to-solution savings.

For example, 2 NVIDIA HGX nodes with 16 NVIDIA H100 GPUs that cost $400K can replace 960 nodes of CPU servers that cost $10M for the same LLM workload.

NVIDIA chips carry the value of the full-stack, not just the chip.

Cost comparison example based on latest available NVIDIA A100 GPU and Intel CPU inference results in the commercially available category of the MLPerf industry benchmark; includes related infrastructure costs such as networking.
